# Example 1: Improving performance by running tasks concurrently

def task1():
    print("Task 1 started")
    # Task logic here

def task2():
    print("Task 2 started")
    # Task logic here

# Create threads for each task
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=task1)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=task2)

# Start the threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Example 2: Handling multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main program

def long_running_task():
    print("Long running task started")
    # Task logic here

thread3 = threading.Thread(target=long_running_task)
thread3.start()

# Main program logic continues without waiting for thread3 to finish

# Example 3: Updating UI elements in response to asynchronous events

def update_ui():
    # Update UI logic here

# Configure a Tkinter GUI
root = tk.Tk()

# Update UI in response to events

# Example 4: Processing large amounts of data in the background
def process_data(data):
    print("Processing data in the background")
    # Data processing logic here

# Assuming 'big_data' is a large dataset
big_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]

thread4 = threading.Thread(target=process_data, args=(big_data,))
thread4.start()

# Example 5: Performing network requests without freezing the UI

def make_network_request():
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    print("Network request completed with response:", response.text)

thread5 = threading.Thread(target=make_network_request)
thread5.start()

# Main program
root.mainloop()  # Ensure the Tkinter GUI stays responsive
