Why are you reading this? Probably easier to just copy an existing language
definition and edit that.

Defining a language:
  - File name is shortname.txt - always lowercase. ("js.txt")

  - 1st line: display name
  - 2nd-Nth lines: key: value definitions
  - Nth: newline
  - Rest: Description. (Currently unused?)

Detail information keys:

       ext: File extension.
       css: What does highlight.js know this language as? Prefixed with "language-"
            If not given, syntax highlighting will not work.
  inherits: Which language (by shortname) does this inherit from? e.g: Node
            inherits from general javascript, but shows node-isms.
   comment: Characters which, if they start a line, are recognized as comments,
            which are used to create keyword searches. If not provided, the script
	    will use both # and //.
categories: One or more words stating which categories this language fits in
