This category inherits JavaScript, but will show Node.js-isms where it may
differ.

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that
can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8
JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
